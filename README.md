# autoxgboost

Automatic tuning and fitting of [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) with [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) and [mlrMBO](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO).

**Work in progress**! This is a very early version, so a lot can (and will) change in the future.

Currently only binary classification is supported, but that will change soon.
